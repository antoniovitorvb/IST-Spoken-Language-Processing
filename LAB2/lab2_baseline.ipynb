    "### Laboratory Assignment 2 - Spoken Language Indentification challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "The second laboratory assignment of the course is designed to simulate a **spoken language identification** challenge. In this challenge, partipants (a.k.a students enrolled in the course) receive a train, development and evaluation (blind) data set, and a simple (and weak) baseline system for the task at hand: closed-set identification of the spoken language in a given audio file out of a set of six target langauges: Basque,  Catalan,  English,  Galician,  Portuguese and  Spanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **goal** for each participant is to develop/build the best spoken language identification system. To this end, participants are encouraged to modify this baseline, incorporate any other techniques and in general explore any approach that permit  improving their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the first week (Part 1), students are expected to:\n",
    "- Run and understand the main components of the baseline.\n",
    "- Propose and develop simple modifications to the baseline feature extraction process.\n",
    "- Propose and develop simple modifications to the baseline GMM language models.\n",
    "- Evaluate the models on the development partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the second week (Part 2), students are expected to:\n",
    "- Propose and develop other *classical* modifications to any component of the processing pipeline (openSMILE features, segment-based features, SVM classifiers, MLP/CNN classifiers, etc.)\n",
    "- Run and understand the second part of Notebook that explores a pre-trained model.\n",
    "- Propose and develop more recent advanced approaches, including x-vectors.\n",
    "- Evaluate the models on the development partition.\n",
    "- Obtain predictions for the blind test partition and prepare the submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge distinguishes two different tracks or evaluation conditions:\n",
    "- Track 1 - Participants are not allowed to use any kind of pre-trained model (such as x-vectors).\n",
    "- Track 2 - Participants are allowed to use anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data consists of mono audio files sampled at 16 kHz all of them containing speech of only one of the following target languages:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "LANGUAGES = ('Basque',  'Catalan',  'English',  'Galician',  'Portuguese',  'Spanish')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is organized in 4 partitions:\n",
    "- `'train'`: This is the full training set, consisting of 3060 clean audio samples correponding to speech segments of TV broadcast shows. (**ATENTION**: Do not use this dataset for training your models, unless your system is very fast or if you want to build your final model. It can be slow)\n",
    "- `'train100'`: This is a subset of the full training set that consists of 100 audio files per target language (**RECOMMENDATION**: Use this partition in your quick experiments, to more rapidly validate alternatives)\n",
    "- `'dev'`: This is the development set. It contains audio extracted from YouTube. You will typically use this to validate the quality of your model.\n",
    "- `'evl'`: This is the evaluation set. It contains audio extracted from YouTube. You don't have the groud-truth for this set. You are expected to produce it and submit it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this challenge is a subset of the KALAKA-3 database: https://aclanthology.org/L14-1576/\n",
    "\n",
    "The  difference is that only the clean train audio segments and the Plenty Closed evaluation condition have been considered. "
